It got it snow, it got it snow, it got it snow I don't know what I'm gonna do Just push my crews like me My Floyd, Jack Double 10, Austin Lim, You start with me and they jump in You won't even care if the U.N. says no Play American like I thought he had a weapon, no If they'd shoot all blocks, I'll suffer the snow All year round, wringly brothers, clowns and others Word to your mother, I'm right, ice When I let try your best, I still feel right And you guys claim new boys take me away
